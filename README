ntsdate - a minimalistic RFC8915 implementation


CONTENTS
--------

ntsdate consists of the following subfolders:
crypto: supplying TLS1.3, AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256, SHA256 via wolfssl (to be downloaded separately)
libnts: a rather minimal implementation of the NTS Key Exchange and NTS protected NTP query logic supporting custom transport
libnts-netio: implementing the custom transport / network-related part of the interface required by libnts
libnts-log2syslog: providing a possible implementation of Log specified by the interface required by libnts using vsyslog
ntsdate: final executeable to be invoked by user

Furthermore, an advanced demonstrative example leveraging custom transport and cross-compilation is provided:
host: normal world ELF binary example requesting a timestamp
ta: secure world executable providing the custom transport interface to libnts and tunneling requests to normal world
inetsocket: normal world supplicant plugin providing the normal world endpoint by relying on libnts-netio for the implementation


BUILDING
--------

Step 1:
Provide wolfSSL v5.6.6-stable in crypto/wolfssl. At the the time of writing, you could run, e.g.,
  cd crypto
  git clone -b v5.6.6-stable --depth 1 https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl wolfssl
  cd ..

Step 2:
Run
  make
to generate ntsdate/ntsdate.


If you happen to have a suitable cross-compilation infrastructure in place and want to experiment with the custom transport example,
run
  make clean
  make ta
to build an linux executable (host/nts_via_inetsocket_plugin), a "trusted application" (ta/out/9a743b32-06a5-4e32-bf15-82de3dc49472.ta)
and a plugin providing network facilities of linux to the trusted application (inetsocket/e0bb2422-a34e-4972-9c4f-17ad2e7ee965.plugin).
