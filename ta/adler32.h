     Update a running Adler-32 checksum with the bytes buf[0..len-1] and
   return the updated checksum. An Adler-32 value is in the range of a 32-bit
   unsigned integer. If buf is Z_NULL, this function returns the required
   initial value for the checksum.

     An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC-32 but can be computed
   much faster.

   Usage example:

     uLong adler = adler32(0L, Z_NULL, 0);

     while (read_buffer(buffer, length) != EOF) {
       adler = adler32(adler, buffer, length);
     }
     if (adler != original_adler) error();

/*
     Same as adler32(), but with a size_t length.
